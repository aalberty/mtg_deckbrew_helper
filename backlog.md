## functionality
- [ ] `edit` button: open the modal experience again, but with a save button instead of a submit (doesn't add a new decklist, modifies the one that you opened)
- [ ] "remove deck": button that's greyed out unless you have decks selected. confirm before delete

## ui
- [ ] figure out what's going on with opacity on the ::before element for the modal-backdrop
